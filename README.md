# ai-interview-assistent
The tool I built to assist with my interview was a python script which records a response from a question I, the interviewer, ask and based on the transcribed response and context of the previous question provides the most relevant follow up question. This follow up question is determined based on a branching tree of categories and subcategories leading to specific questions, which were created with fleshing out this project's Problem Statement in mind. The goal of this tool is to allow myself to be fully engaged and participating in the interview in order to get the best responses from the interviewee, while I allow an AI assistant to parse through pre-prepared potential follow up questions. Ideally this tool works in such a manner that I engage with a single question and that question's response at time, prodding at small details in the response for clarification, while the mental labor, awkwardness, and distraction of looking through a script for pre-prepared questions is passed off to an assistant. 

I utilized OpenAIâ€™s chat-gpt-4o-mini model via an API to suggest the follow up question based on a given response and list of pre-prepared questions, as well as Google's transcription found through the Python Speech Recognition library. 


## Questions
See the file [get_ai_response.py](get_ai_response.py) to get an exact look at the logic and tree structure of this tool. Below is the opening question and follow-up tree in bulleted format.
